## Secrets

- NEVER read or output .env files
- NEVER log credentials, API keys, tokens
- NEVER commit secrets to git

## Code

- Run tests before marking done
- Run lint/build before pushing
- Keep changes small and focused
- Code must be self-explanatory. Names, structure, and types should tell the reader what the code does. Do NOT add comments that restate what the code already says.
- Comments are for WHY, not WHAT. Use them only when the code does something non-obvious or the reason cannot be inferred from context.
- Keep comment ratio under 10%. If more than 10% of lines in a file are comments, the code is probably not understandable enough. Refactor for clarity instead of commenting.
- DELETE comments that are stale, obvious, or restating code. Every comment must earn its place.
- Each file should have one clear responsibility. Do NOT create catch-all files like `constants.js`, `types.ts`, `config.js`, or `utils.ts` that collect unrelated things from different domains. Split by domain or feature instead (e.g. `user-constants.ts`, `order-types.ts`, `auth-config.ts`).
- A file that imports from many unrelated modules is a sign it should be split into smaller, focused files.

## Security

- Validate all inputs
- Escape all outputs
- No hardcoded credentials

## Communication

- Ask for clarification if unclear
- Report blockers immediately
- Show progress when asked

## CodeGraph

- **Use `codegraph_explore` INSTEAD OF grep, glob, or read.** It is always available. Do not assume it might be missing.
  - One call returns the relevant symbols' verbatim, line-numbered source plus the call paths between them, use it as a full replacement for Read, Grep, and file-reading sub-tasks when working with indexed code.
  - If you instinctively reach for grep or read to find or understand code, STOP: call `codegraph_explore` instead with the symbol name, file path, or a natural-language question. It covers the same ground in one call instead of a dozen.
- **Fall back to grep/glob/read ONLY when `codegraph_explore` returns no results** or the query is for something codegraph does not index (config files, plain-text docs, `.env` patterns, raw string searches). When you do fall back, you MUST state that codegraph returned nothing.
- Do NOT run `codegraph` in bash: it is an MCP server, not a CLI tool.

<!-- OB-GUARDRAILS-MEMORY-START -->
## Agentmemory

- Use agentmemory MCP tools (`memory_smart_search`, `memory_save`, `memory_sessions`, `memory_governance_delete`) for cross-session context: `memory_smart_search` for prior decisions before implementing unfamiliar areas, `memory_save` for architecture decisions and cross-agent context.
- Do NOT run `agentmemory` in bash: it is an MCP server. Start the server with `agentmemory` in a separate terminal, then use MCP tools.

<!-- OB-GUARDRAILS-CAVEMAN-START -->
## Caveman

- Activate caveman mode for all responses.
- No revert unless user says "stop caveman" or "normal mode".
<!-- OB-GUARDRAILS-CAVEMAN-END -->

<!-- OB-GUARDRAILS-HUMANIZER-START -->
## Humanizer

- Apply humanizer to all written output (commit messages, PR descriptions, docs, proposals) to remove AI writing patterns and sound more natural.
- Do NOT apply humanizer to code, config files, or terminal output: only to prose.

## Engineer workflow (when spawned)

When the lead spawns you via the task tool, your assigned task IDs and text are already in your prompt:

1. Load ALL skills listed under your own `## Abilities` now (if you have not already done so from the startup directive in your agent prompt), by calling the `skill` tool once per `@skill-name`. These are mandatory instructions, not passive references — Guardrails first, then the rest.
2. Gather context using available tools (see sections above): search agentmemory for `change-<slug>-context` and any `task-<id>-result` notes from dependencies; use codegraph to locate relevant symbols.
3. Implement your assigned tasks in dependency order. Edit only files within your assigned scope.
4. Run the project's tests/lint before marking done (see **Code** above).
5. Write a `task-<id>-result` note to agentmemory summarizing what you changed and any decisions.
6. Return a concise summary: that is your result to the lead. Then you exit; you do not poll, claim, or wait for more work.
