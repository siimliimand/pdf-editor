# Repo Help

Display the following reference to the user exactly as written. Do not summarize.

## Commands

### Not sure where to start?

**`/repo-onboard`**: Guided tour of the project and its agentic infrastructure. Explains agents, commands, skills, OpenSpec workflow, and configuration. Read-only: no files modified.

**`/plan-explore`**: Your backlog is unclear, you have a half-formed idea, or you need to think through a problem before committing to a plan. This is a thinking partner, not an executor.

**`/plan-propose <url or idea>`**: You have a work item URL, or a clear idea and you want to turn it into a structured plan (proposal, specs, tasks). Enriches each task with the best matching agent and model before showing you the plan. Nothing is implemented until you confirm.

---

### Ready to implement?

**`/plan-quick <task>`**: Quick plan for focused changes. Reads the codebase, creates a task checklist in the Todo pane. No files, no OpenSpec. Then you decide: `/plan-apply` to implement, or `/plan-propose` for a full OpenSpec plan.

**`/plan-apply`**: Implement a plan. Detects the source automatically: OpenSpec-annotated tasks (from `/plan-propose`) run as parallel subagent waves; Todo pane tasks (from `/plan-quick`) run sequentially in-session.

**`/plan-goal <feature or URL>`**: Fully autonomous, no confirmations. Branches off `main`, then runs propose → apply → archive on that branch (each phase its own commit). Default: merges to `main` and deletes the branch. Add `push` keyword to push the branch only. Add `pr` keyword to push + create a PR. Built for loop-engineering / unattended runs. Stops only on a hard failure, leaving the branch unmerged.

---

### Done implementing?

**`/ops-ship`**: Create a PR for the current feature branch with screenshots if UI changed.

**`/ops-review`**: Read and triage PR review feedback. If you share a PR URL or say "I've added comments to the PR", it reads and classifies the review comments so you know what to fix. Fixing is done via `/plan-apply`.

**`/ops-backlog`**: Create an issue in the backlog platform (GitHub, Azure DevOps, Jira) from a description.

**`/plan-archive`**: Mark a completed change as archived in OpenSpec. Run this after the PR is merged.

---

### Maintaining the project?

**`/make-engineer`**: Add a custom specialist engineer to the team. Interactive persona-driven form: pick a persona, then confirm an inspected-and-recommended set of skills (architecture/patterns like FSD or design patterns, framework, testing, infra) before anything installs. Future `/plan-apply` runs will prefer it when its domain matches.

**`/make-architecture`**: Regenerate `ARCHITECTURE.md` from the current codebase. Safe to rerun any time the architecture evolves.

**`/make-design`**: Regenerate `DESIGN.md` from the design system (Tailwind, CSS vars, tokens, etc.).

**`/make-guardrails`**: Generate a `ob-guardrails-project` skill from `ARCHITECTURE.md` and project config files. Extracts concrete rules (architecture boundaries, naming, code style, testing, git workflow) that all agents must follow. Updates every `*-engineer.md` to load the skill.

**`/make-user-model <tier> <model>`**: Set the model for a tier (`plan`, `build`, or `fast`). Writes to `.opencode/opencode-onboard.json` (`models`). Use `user` prefix for a personal override: `/make-user-model user fast opencode/big-pickle`. Use a model id or `current` for the active session model. Restart opencode for the `ob-subagent-tiers` plugin to rebuild tier agents.

### Typical workflows

**Complex change:**
```
/plan-explore   ← optional: think it through first
/plan-propose   ← create the plan
/plan-apply     ← implement with the team
/ops-ship        ← ship
/plan-archive   ← close out
```

**Quick change:**
```
/plan-quick     ← create a focused task list
/plan-apply     ← implement
```

**Unattended / loop-engineering:**
```
/plan-goal <description>  ← full pipeline, no interaction
```
