description: Walk the user through the project and its agentic infrastructure. Explains what exists, how agents work, and how to use the system.
---

This command is a guided tour. Do NOT modify any files. Read and explain only.

---

## Step 1, Project overview

Read `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `DESIGN.md`. Summarize:

- What this project is (name, purpose, domain)
- Tech stack (languages, frameworks, build system)
- Project structure (key directories and what they contain)

Keep it to 3–5 bullet points. Focus on what a new contributor needs to know.

---

## Step 2, Agent infrastructure

Inspect `.opencode/agents/` and list every agent file. For each agent, read its frontmatter and summarize:

- **Agent name and role** (primary, subagent, or specialist)
- **Model tier** it uses (plan, build, or fast)
- **Key abilities**: what it can do

Present as a table:

| Agent | Role | Tier | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Then explain the agent selection model:
- **Primary agents** appear in Tab and handle direct user interaction
- **Subagent engineers** are spawned by the lead for parallel implementation waves
- **Specialist engineers** are preferred when their domain matches the task; `fullstack-engineer` is the user's planning agent (`mode: primary`), not a spawned worker — if no specialist matches, create one with `/make-engineer`

---

## Step 3, Command reference

Read every `.md` file in `.opencode/commands/`. List each command with its name and description:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| ... | ... |

Group them by workflow phase if possible:
- **Planning**: plan-explore, plan-propose, plan-quick, plan-goal
- **Implementation**: plan-apply, plan-archive
- **Maintenance**: make-architecture, make-design, make-engineer, make-guardrails
- **Shipping**: ops-ship, ops-review, ops-backlog
- **Setup**: repo-initialize, make-user-model, repo-help

---

## Step 4, Skills

Inspect `.agents/skills/` (if present). List installed skills with a one-line description each. Note which are platform-specific (userstory, pullrequest) vs general-purpose.

---

## Step 5, OpenSpec workflow

Explain the OpenSpec change lifecycle:

1. **Explore** (`/plan-explore`): investigate and discuss, no files created
2. **Propose** (`/plan-propose`): structured plan, saved to `openspec/changes/`
3. **Apply** (`/plan-apply`): implement tasks via parallel subagent waves
4. **Archive** (`/plan-archive`): finalize and clean up

Explain `openspec/config.yaml`: what it contains and why it matters.

---

## Step 6, Configuration

Explain `opencode-onboard.json`:
- What each field controls (platform, models, agents, tools, source)
- How to change the model for a tier (`/make-user-model`)
- What `agents.maxConcurrent` does

---

## Step 7, Quick tips

End with 3–5 practical tips:

- How to start working: "Run `/plan-goal` with a description of what you want to build"
- How to add a specialist: "Run `/make-engineer`"
- How to regenerate docs: "Run `/make-architecture` or `/make-design`"
- How to see all commands: "Run `/repo-help`"
- How to refresh config after changes: "Re-run `npx opencode-onboard` in the terminal"

## Guardrails

- Do NOT modify any files
- Do NOT create branches or commits
- Only read and explain
