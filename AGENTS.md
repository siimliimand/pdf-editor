# AGENTS.md

<!-- OB-INITIALIZED: 2026-07-18 -->

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working in this repository.

*Agent-agnostic, works with OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, etc.*

## Context

Load DESIGN.md for design principles and guidelines. Load ARCHITECTURE.md for system architecture and component interactions. These files are generated during initialization and updated as the codebase evolves.

**Command aliases:** OpenSpec skills may reference `/opsx-propose`, `/opsx-apply`, `/opsx-archive`, or `/opsx-explore`. Always substitute them with the `ob-plan-propose`, `ob-plan-apply`, `ob-plan-archive`, `ob-plan-explore` skills respectively (user-facing command names: `/plan-propose`, `/plan-apply`, `/plan-archive`, `/plan-explore`), and never mention the `opsx-` names to the user.

## I Am the Lead, Full Workflow Ownership

<!-- OB-PLATFORM-WORKFLOW-START -->
When the user provides a work item URL or says "implement the plan" or "I've added comments to the PR", **I own the full lifecycle**. I load the appropriate userstory skill and coordinate implementation as native subagent waves via the `ob-plan-apply` skill.

Trigger patterns, I recognize ALL of these, exact wording does not matter:
- User pastes or mentions a GitHub Issue URL → load `ob-userstory` skill → parse issue → load the `ob-plan-propose` skill → confirm with user → load the `ob-plan-apply` skill → ship
- `implement the plan` / `implement` / `start` / `go` → load the `ob-plan-apply` skill → ship
- `I've added comments to the PR` → read PR comments → fix → update PR
- Any GitHub PR URL in a feedback/fix request (e.g. "check comments", "fix PR feedback") → run PR Feedback Loop

**A GitHub URL in the user's message is a strong trigger: follow the pipeline unless the user explicitly asks for analysis or context only.**
<!-- OB-PLATFORM-WORKFLOW-END -->

**Never delegate without a plan. Default to specialists for implementation. If a subagent wave repeatedly fails, stop forcing it: report, then continue in the main session or ask the user.**

## Engineer Selection

Inspect `.opencode/agents/*.md` before spawning. Prefer the most specialized custom engineer. **Never assign `fullstack-engineer` to a task** — it is `mode: primary` (the user's planning agent), not a spawned worker. If no specialist matches, tell the user to create one with `/make-engineer`. Never spawn engineers not present in that directory.

**Full wave protocol, pipeline phases, and concurrency limits:** see the `ob-plan-apply` skill (authoritative). Max concurrent agents is `agents.maxConcurrent` in `.opencode/opencode-onboard.json`.

## Skills

Skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Always installed: `@ob-default`, `@ob-guardrails-generic`, `@ob-guardrails-project`, `@browser-automation`. Agents load them via `@skill-name` in their `## Abilities` section.

<!-- OB-PLATFORM-SKILLS-GUIDE-START -->
Platform skills (GitHub):
- `@ob-userstory`: load when a GitHub Issue URL is detected. Fetches the issue via `gh` CLI and creates an OpenSpec change. NEVER use webfetch to access GitHub URLs.
- `ob-ops-ship`: load in ship mode to create a PR with screenshots, or in feedback mode to read and classify PR review comments.

<!-- CODEGRAPH_START -->
## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tool** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call — the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them, including dynamic-dispatch hops grep can't follow. Name a file or symbol in the query to read its current line-numbered source. If it's listed but deferred, load it by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` prints the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely — indexing is the user's decision.
